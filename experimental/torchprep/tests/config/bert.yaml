# Each model can have multiple inputs
# Each input has a dtype, device and shape
# Some shapes can be arbitrary like a positive integer for batch size

#TODO: Untested

# BERT model
input1:
  dtype: "int32"
  device: "cpu"
  shape: [1] # the first element is the batch size
  high : 10 # max value
  mode : "latency"

input2:
  dtype: "float32"
  device: "cpu"
  shape: [1] # the first element is the batch size
  high : 10 # max value
  mode : "latency"
